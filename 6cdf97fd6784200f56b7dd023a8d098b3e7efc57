      "message": "This is a marker file that\u0027s only created and deleted by system_server, anything else only ever checks if the file exists. It gets created by SettingsProvider when a flag is enabled. The flag is stored in SettingsProvider, so SettingsProvider can do the flag lookup -\u003e file creation. aconfigd can\u0027t easily read the flag in SettingsProvider, as SP starts up later in the boot process.\n\naconfigd will never care about that particular file, system_server is the only one that interacts with it. aconfig_storage_metadata_file is the policy associated with the directory this marker file lives in. All of the other files in that directory are managed by aconfigd",
