If it\u0027s a system-provided VM, it should be ok as the system is trusted to know that it has the responsibility of verification. However, Alan made a specific request for the neverallow rule to be added b/261477008#comment4 and that\u0027s consistent with preventing non-system microdroid VMs from being able to dynamically load code.\n\nSince we already have a mechanism to allow extra code to be loaded (extra APKs), it feels better to make use of the existing mechanism rather than introduce a new dynamic access control for executing from the encrypted store based on provenance of the VM?",
