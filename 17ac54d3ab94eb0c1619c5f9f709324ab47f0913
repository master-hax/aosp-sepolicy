Since sigkill is only allowed for `artd_subprocess_type` on line 137, an addition neverallow rule seems to be a duplicate.\n\nAs the comment above this line says, this neverallow rule is just to make sure  artd_subprocess_type is complete (i.e., if someone adds another `domain_auto_trans` rule for `artd`, they will have to add that domain to `artd_subprocess_type`, or they\u0027ll get a build error from this neverallow rule.",
