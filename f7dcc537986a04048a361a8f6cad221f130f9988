      "message": "The code path from `dexopt` in the installd service is dead since UDC, but there\u0027s also one from [otapreopt](https://source.corp.google.com/h/googleplex-android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/native/cmds/installd/otapreopt.cpp;l\u003d519-535;drc\u003dbb9872b32007d9b70937d0e0826dfe6e84759359), and the legacy OTA dexopt hasn\u0027t been torn down yet. However that call site should end up in the `otapreopt` binary which uses the `postinstall_dexopt` sepolicy domain rather than this one (and there\u0027s already no domain transition to dexoptanalyzer there). So I suppose this is safe.",
