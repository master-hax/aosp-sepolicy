      "message": "why is write needed? That shouldn\u0027t be necessary for sending data. Perhaps you\u0027re trying to do too much in this line?\n\nI wonder if this should be two separate allow rules:\nallow statsd priv_app:fifo_file write;\nallow statsd appdomain:fifo_file { read getattr };\n\nWith a note that says that statsd can send data to a priv_app, but other apps can only send data to statsd?\n\nPlease also include a comment within policy to clarify that access control for sending data to statsd is actually done elsewhere e.g. by gating access to the service, Android permissions, or however it\u0027s done. I don\u0027t know, but hopefully you do :).",

Our current workaround is to have system_server do a copy and recreate the file descriptor as a workaround. It would be preferable if write permissions were available as well so it is possible to potentially remove this workaround for V+\n\nAdded the comment on what gates access to the service",
