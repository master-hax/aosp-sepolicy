# vdc is a helper program for making Binder calls to vold.  It is spawned from
# init for various reasons, such as initializing file-based encryption and
# metadata encryption, and managing userdata checkpointing.
#
# We also transition into this domain from dumpstate, when
# collecting bug reports.
