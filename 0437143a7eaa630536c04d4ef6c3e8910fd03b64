      "message": "So, as far as vendor processes are concerned, init is special because it\u0027s built on system, but it\u0027s ambiguous in SEPolicy whether init directly accesses a property, or whether it does so on behalf of a .rc file that is on the vendor partition, so from a Treble perspective, the effect of this change is that vendor .rc files may read vold properties.\n\nIf vendor_init does need to read certain properties, then it\u0027s probably best to make a separate set of properties which are only exposed to vendor.\n\nOtherwise, ideally we could only use system here.\n\nCan you point to the change which caused these properties to be needed?",
