      "message": "Yeah. Not sure how important it is really. It is harmless, but useless, to include the keystore AVs in Microdroid.\n\nI wonder if we should split classes/access_vectors into kernel ones + userspace ones, and then have the kernel files common between Android + Microdroid, but diverge on userspace?\n\nBut perhaps that could be a future step. I have no objection to this CL, and consistency is probably more important than minimalism.",
